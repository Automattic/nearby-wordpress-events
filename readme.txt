Shows you upcoming local WordPress events in your wp-admin Dashboard


== Description ==

This plugin updates the existing News dashboard widget to also include upcoming WordCamps and WordPress meetups in
your area. If you have multiple users on your site, each one will be shown the events that are close to their
individual location. The widget will try to automatically detect your location, but you'll also be able to enter
any city you'd like.


### Why?

The community that has been created around WordPress is one of its best features, and one of the primary reasons
for its success, but many users are still unaware that it exists, and aren't taking advantage of all of the
resources that it makes available to them.

Inviting more people to join the community will help to increase its overall health, diversity, and effectiveness,
which in turn helps to ensure that WordPress will continue to thrive in the years to come.

wp-admin is the perfect place to show these events, since that's the place where virtually all WordPress users
already visit. Instead of expecting them to come to us, we can bring relevant information directly to them.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What information is collected, and what is it used for? =

The plugin sends each user's timezone, locale, and IP address to `api.wordpress.org`, in order to determine their
location, so that they can be shown events that are close to that location. If the user requests events near a
specific city, then that is also sent. The data is not stored permenantly, not used for any other purpose, and not
shared with anyone outside of WordPress.org, with the exception of any conditions covered in the
[WordPress.org privacy policy](https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/).
